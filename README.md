# Libft-42cursus
A simple static library, the first project in the 42 curriculum.

## The hell is this?
Well, this is a library containing the re-implemenation of some functions from the standard C library.
By code, I mean spaghetti, literally...

## How to use it?
Simply run make (or make bonus if you want the extra linked-lists manipulation functions) and then link the library using the -l flag.
That's it!
